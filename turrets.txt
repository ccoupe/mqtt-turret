done: assemble/fit servos, diodes
   -- horns need fitting.
   -- dremel out rafters
   -- hot glue for horn <-> mount(s)
2. CAD mods and reprint:
3. Larger picture of dual turrets, pi and electronics board mounting
      and cover. Where is it placed in re: Trumpy Bear. shelf? Rear corner?
      Do I want sh1106 and HR504 included - I Think I do for pi0 in the corner.
   -- One turret pair at TB (pi4?) one in back - pi0
    
done: wire to pi0
   Solder header to pi0.
   Pin    GPIO  
   2      GPIO 2  Yellow  SDA         sh1106
   3      GPIO 3  Orange  SCL         sh1106
   11     GPIO 17 White   transister - Laser diode 'fire' when 'on'
   13     GPIO 27 Orange  pan servo - software pcm
   15     GPIO 22 Gray    tilt servo - softwar pcm
   will power from separate usb port from Pi.
   
   Tilt 45 is level, 0 as far down as possible. 135 is straight up
   Pan 90 is center 0 far left, 180 far right
   
done: Diode on/off not as simple as I hoped.
   NPN 2N2222 - emitter to gnd. 1Kohm base to signal (3v). Collector to neg side
   of laser diode.  Diode Plus to 5v.

done: python test code. From E.C. in ~/Projects/iot/turrents

done: PCA9675 for servos. Needs AdaFruit lib and blinka compat layer.
6. power issues, packaging
   need a small pcb with transistor+resistor + 5v + gnd 
    add HR504 voltage divider? 2nd Laser?

      homie mqtt stuff.
      PCA9675 port number or
      pi pin number for diode, pan, tilt
      turrets should be json list of turret. turret is a dict
    done: Class for Turrent, object for each. 
    
Square: MQTT control/set Payload for square (exec)
  {"exec": 1, "count": <n>, ["steps": <n> | "time": <sec>], "pause": <sec>}
    one of 'steps' or 'time'. 
    
Vsig, Hzig: HMQTT control/set Payload for vertical zigzag (exec = 6) or horizontal (exec = 5)
  {"exec": vzig, "count": <n>, "lines": <n>, ["steps": <n> | "time": <sec>]
  , "pause": <sec>}
      time is requested total for all lines. 
      pause is additional time at end of line. 
      
Circle: MQTT control/set Payload for circle
  '{"exec": "circle", "count": 1, "radius": 40, "time": 2}'
  '{"exec": "circle", "count": 2, "radius": 55, "steps": 30, "pause": 0.2}'
  
Crosshairs
  '{"exec": "crosshairs", "count": 2, "length": 30}'
     steps, time, pause are valid but a little funny. Time is OK.
     
Diamond
  '{"exec": "diamond", "count": 2, "length": 30, "time": 2}'
  
Random - point cloud - depends on persistence of vision.
  '{"exec": "random", "count": 1, "length": 30, "time": 2}'
  '{"exec": "random", "count": 1, "length": 30, "steps": 40, "pause": 0.25}'
  using pause and time: reduces the number of steps to fit time
